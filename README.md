InterFace is a networking app made for events and conferences using the Microsoft Cognitive Services Face ID API. It allows users to connect with others using only the camera. When first launched, the user makes a profile together with a picture. This profile is then uploaded to a server, and the Face ID API is trained such that it can recognize the new user. Users can connect with others by taking a picture with a camera, which sends the picture to the Face ID API for recognition, after which the names of the people in the picture are displayed using bounding boxes. When a box is tapped, that users profile is shown.
